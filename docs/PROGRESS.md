## 2026-03-28 (Phase 2)

**Done:**
- **Phase 2: Forecast API endpoint**
  - `src/lib/forecaster.ts` — `ForecastResponse` type; `buildForecastPrompt()` (condensed per-year US + India summaries, schema doc, regime instructions); `parseForecastResponse()` (JSON extraction from code fences, field normalization with safe fallbacks, headroom recompute); `generateForecast()` (Claude Sonnet call)
  - `src/lib/forecast-cache.ts` — `getForecastCache()` / `saveForecastCache()` / `clearForecastCache()` backed by `.forecast-cache.json` (mirrors `.tax-returns.json` pattern)
  - `src/index.ts` — `GET /api/forecast` (returns cached or 404), `POST /api/forecast` (generates + caches), `clearForecastCache()` wired into `/api/clear-data`
  - `src/lib/forecaster.test.ts` — 17 unit tests: `buildForecastPrompt` (6 tests), `parseForecastResponse` (11 tests) covering all normalization paths and edge cases

**Decisions:**
- Prompt sends condensed per-year summaries, not raw full JSON — avoids display-only fields (qualified dividends, rollover amounts) confusing the model; keeps tokens lean
- `parseForecastResponse` always recomputes `bracket.headroom` from `ceiling - projectedIncome` — Claude occasionally miscalculates arithmetic
- Cache is a flat `.forecast-cache.json` file (Phase 4 will upgrade to SQLite if needed); cleared on `/api/clear-data`
- No `ForecastResponse` Zod schema — parse + normalize manually (consistent with parser.ts pattern; Zod overhead not warranted for a single AI response that we own)
- India section in response is silently omitted if any required field is missing (never error on partial India data)

**Tests:** 113 pass (96 existing + 17 new forecast tests)

**Known gaps:**
- Integration tests (GET/POST route cycle) skipped — unit tests cover all logic; cache read/write exercised indirectly through unit test fixtures
- No auth error handling on forecast endpoint (unlike chat/parse routes) — forecast is server-side only, no API key exposure risk

**Next:** Phase 3 — Forecast view components (`ForecastView.tsx`, `BracketBar.tsx`, `AssumptionsCard.tsx`, `ActionItemsCard.tsx`, `RiskFlags.tsx`, `IndiaRegimeCard.tsx`, `ForecastChatStrip.tsx`)

## 2026-03-28 (Phase 1)

**Done:**
- **Phase 1: Sidebar layout refactor** — replaced top header + horizontal tab navigation with a left sidebar (192px)
  - Logo + "beta" badge
  - Country toggle (🇺🇸/🇮🇳) in sidebar, conditional on India data
  - Views section: Summary, By Year, Forecast nav items
  - Years section: all parsed years listed descending
  - Footer: Chat toggle button + actions menu (add return, import ITR, reset data)
- **`src/lib/nav.ts`** — extracted all nav functions from App.tsx into testable module; added `"forecast"` to `SelectedView` type; added `getMostRecentYearItem()`
- **`src/lib/nav.test.ts`** — 24 new unit tests covering buildUsNavItems, buildIndiaNavItems, getDefaultUsSelection, getDefaultIndiaSelection, getMostRecentYearItem, parseSelectedId
- **`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`** — new sidebar component
- **`src/components/ForecastView.tsx`** — placeholder "coming soon" view for Phase 3
- **`src/components/MainPanel.tsx`** — removed entire header (~200 lines), CommonProps slimmed from 20 fields to 4
- **Documentation** — ARCHITECTURE.md, FORECAST_SPEC.md (with testing requirements per phase + model decision), README rewritten as TaxLens, CLAUDE.md updated with docs index

**Decisions:**
- `getMostRecentYearItem` used by "By Year" sidebar item: clicking it when on summary/forecast navigates to the most recent year; clicking when already on a year is a no-op
- Forecast nav item shows placeholder until Phase 3 — wired end-to-end so the nav works now
- All nav functions moved to `nav.ts` to make them unit-testable without React

**Tests:** 96 pass (72 existing + 24 new nav tests)

**Known gaps:**
- j/k keyboard shortcuts still work for year navigation but don't cover Summary/Forecast views — acceptable for now
- Delete year (right-click context menu) was on the old header tabs — removed for now, will add back in sidebar if needed
- Mobile: sidebar doesn't collapse yet (out of scope for Phase 1)

**Next:** Phase 2 — `POST /api/forecast` endpoint (Claude Sonnet call, ForecastResponse schema, structured output)

## 2026-03-21

**Done:**
- **India tax support** — full end-to-end pipeline for Indian ITR returns
  - `src/lib/schema.ts`: added `itrForm` field (`"ITR-1" | "ITR-2" | "ITR-3" | "ITR-4"`)
  - `src/lib/pdf-utils.ts`: `unwrapIfJavaSerialized()` — extracts real PDF from Java object serialization wrapper (Indian IT portal wraps PDFs in Java serialization with magic bytes `aced0005`; actual PDF starts at `%PDF` offset inside)
  - `src/lib/india-parser.ts`: two-pass Sonnet parsing for ITR-2, single-pass for ITR-1; Haiku-based form type detection on first page; proactive token budget (sliding window over actual `response.usage` tokens, 60s window) to avoid 429s; `TAIL_PAGES` reduced 15→12
  - `src/lib/india-storage.ts` + `src/lib/prompt.ts`: ITR-1 prompt (no capital gains, correct 3% cess for AY ≤2018-19); ITR-2 prompts updated with dynamic cess rate
  - `scripts/import-india.ts`: uses `unwrapIfJavaSerialized`; parses and saves to `.india-tax-returns.json`
- **India UI** — `App.tsx` + `MainPanel.tsx` country toggle (🇺🇸 US / 🇮🇳 India pills), India year and summary views with chart/table mode toggles
  - `src/components/IndiaReceiptView.tsx`: dynamic form label, dynamic cess label
  - `src/components/IndiaSummaryView.tsx`: ITR-1 badge, "—" for CG on ITR-1 rows, YoY `+X.X%`/`-X.X%` badges (green/red) on Gross Income, STCG, LTCG, Tax Liability (inverted polarity), compact INR formatting with hover tooltips
  - `src/components/IndiaYearCharts.tsx`: income breakdown donut + tax summary bar
  - `src/components/IndiaSummaryCharts.tsx`: Gross Income + Tax Liability grouped bars, Capital Gains trend (ITR-2 years only), Effective Tax Rate line, Refund/Due bar with green/red cells
- **`formatINRCompact`** in `src/lib/format.ts`: compact INR (sub-1L → full, ≥1L → "₹X.XXL", ≥1Cr → "₹X.XXCr"); fixed sign-for-zero bug
- **Tests**: 72 pass (up from 57 before this session)
  - `src/lib/pdf-utils.test.ts` (4 tests): `unwrapIfJavaSerialized` covering real PDF, Java-wrapped, no-PDF-inside, trailing-data
  - `src/lib/india-parser.test.ts` (expanded to 10): `reconcileIndianReturn` covering tax paid recomputation, positive/negative refund, summary sync, preserves AI totalTaxPaid when arrays empty, ITR-1 capital gains zero
  - `src/lib/format.test.ts` (5 new): `formatINRCompact` covering sub-1L, lakhs, crores, negatives, showSign

**Decisions:**
- Java-serialized PDF unwrapping: scan for `%PDF` magic bytes inside Java-serialized blob and `%%EOF` at end — robust even when byte offset varies across years
- ITR-1 uses single-pass Sonnet (not two-pass): forms are 2-5 pages; sending entire doc at once is cheaper and avoids coordination overhead
- Haiku for form type detection: cheap (1 page, simple classification), avoids burning Sonnet quota on a routing decision
- Proactive token budget uses actual `response.usage` (not estimates) in a 60-second sliding window to prevent 429s without over-sleeping
- `TAIL_PAGES` 15→12: tail is Part B-TTI + TDS schedules, 12 pages covers all observed formats; cuts ~2.25K tokens per call
- YoY badges skip comparison if prior year was ITR-1 (no STCG/LTCG data to compare against)
- `formatINRCompact` always uses `toFixed(2)` for lakhs (not conditional on ≥10L) — ₹19.7L vs ₹19.68L looked like a bug at a glance

**Known gaps:**
- ITR-1 detection relies on Haiku reading first page — very old scanned PDFs (2012) may produce OCR artifacts; tested successfully on 2012-2017
- Effective Tax Rate chart uses `taxableIncome`; for ITR-1 this may be 0 (field absent in older forms), showing 0% rate — cosmetically misleading but not wrong
- Pre-existing lint warnings (8) not addressed

**Next:**
- Investigate extraction prompt to prevent `refundOrDue=0` class of AI error at source (identified in 2024 return, manually patched)
- Consider adding `taxableIncome` to `INDIA_ITR1_PROMPT` so effective rate chart works for ITR-1 years
- Continue feature backlog in `docs/FEATURES.md`

## 2026-03-20

**Done:**
- Added `reconcile()` to `parser.ts` — post-parse validation that recomputes `federal.refundOrOwed` (overrides if diff >$1,000, warns only if <$1,000 to avoid Schedule 2 false positives), recomputes all summary fields from canonical sources, and sanity-checks effective rate + AGI vs income.total proximity
- Manually patched `.tax-returns.json` for 2021 (NJ refundOrOwed 0 → -670) and 2024 (federal refundOrOwed 0 → -18,682; NJ refundOrOwed 2890 → -2890)
- Fixed `SummaryCharts.tsx` chart bugs: tooltip key labels showing numbers instead of names, refund/owed bar rendering black
- Added `scripts/validate-returns.ts` — runs `reconcile()` against all stored returns and prints warnings
- Added `scripts/load-from-drive.ts` — bulk-loads PDFs from `~/gdrive` Google Drive mount
- Added `docs/PRFAQ.md` — product narrative for TaxLens vision
- Established project conventions in `CLAUDE.md`: Code Style, Testing, Security, Checkpoint ritual

**Decisions:**
- `$1,000` threshold for federal override: real AI miss was $18,682; Schedule 2 double-counting is ~$100-200 — threshold cleanly separates the two cases
- `income.total` NOT recomputed from `sum(items)` — items array includes display-only entries (qualified dividends, non-taxable pension rollover) that are not part of 1040 line 9
- `taxableIncome` NOT recomputed from `agi - deductions` — some deductions are above-the-line (already baked into AGI), double-subtracting gives wrong result
- State `refundOrOwed` NOT validated by formula — `adjustments` mixes credits (reduce tax directly) and deductions (reduce taxable income); any formula produces only false positives
- "Why" comments allowed in source; "what" comments are not — narrative decisions belong in CLAUDE.md/docs

**Known gaps:**
- `reconcile()` has no unit tests yet — highest priority next
- `.tax-returns.json` manual patches (2021 NJ, 2024 federal) will be lost if PDFs are re-parsed; root cause is in the extraction prompt, not yet fixed
- Pre-existing lint warnings in `src/index.ts` and `src/lib/selector.ts` not addressed

**Next:**
- Write unit tests for `reconcile()` covering: large federal diff override, small diff warn-only, summary recomputation, effective rate sanity check
- Investigate extraction prompt to prevent the 2024 federal refundOrOwed=0 class of error at source
- Continue feature backlog in `docs/FEATURES.md`
